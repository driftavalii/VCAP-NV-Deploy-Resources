###### Design - vSphere Networking Design for the Management Domain [^vvd6.2]

[^vvd6.2]: [vSphere Networking Design for the Management Domain](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Validated-Design/6.2/sddc-architecture-and-design-for-the-management-domain/GUID-451FC9C4-3CEA-45E4-BD3B-727A94225C3F.html)

| Design Goal | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Meet Diverse needs | The network must meet the diverse needs of many different entities in an organization. These entities include applications, services, storage, administrators, and users. |
| Reduce costs | Reducing costs is one of the simpler goals to achieve in the vSphere infrastructure. Server consolidation alone reduces network costs by reducing the number of required network ports and NICs, but a more efficient network design is desirable. For example, configuring two 25-GbE NICs might be more cost effective than configuring four 10-GbE NICs. |
| Improve performance | You can achieve performance improvement and decrease the time that is required to perform maintenance by providing sufficient bandwidth, which reduces contention and latency. |
| Improve availability | A well-designed network improves availability, usually by providing network redundancy. |
| Support security | A well-designed network supports an acceptable level of security through controlled access and isolation, where required. |
| Enhance infrastructure functionality | You can configure the network to support vSphere features such as vSphere vMotion, vSphere High Availability, and vSphere Fault Tolerance.|
